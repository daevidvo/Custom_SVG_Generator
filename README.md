## Description üìù

Create your own (albeit simple) SVG!

Choose your desired text, shape color, text color and desired shape out of the ones available.

Through the utilization of Node.js, Inquirer, and Jest, this application was able to be created.

* Node.js's preinstalled filesystem module along with the built-in JavaScript runtime environment allowed this project to be executed.
* Inquirer's prompt() method allows the application to take in user inputs and manipulate the SVG file based on said inputs. 
* Jest allowed for me to create test cases for the application and ensure that everything was running properly.

## Learning Points üìñ

A major learning point in this project was the usage of class inheritance and TDD.

***Class Inheritance***

Class inheritance is simply creating new instances of a class and that new instance will have the parent's methods and properties.

An example of class inheritance that I used in this application can be seen below:

* Below is the original parent class
``` JavaScript
class Shape { //the parent shape constructor that we'll use to make the other shape classes
    constructor(text, text_color, shape_color){
        this.text = text;
        this.text_color = text_color;
        this.shape_color = shape_color;
    };
};
```
* Below is the child of said parent class inheriting the text, text_color, and shape_color properties
``` JavaScript
class Square extends Shape { //copies the properties of the Shape class from ./shape.js
    constructor(text, text_color, shape_color){
        super(text, text_color, shape_color);
    };
```

***Test Driven Development (TDD)***

TDD is a concept where developers will initially write tests that outline the desired outcome for our code, then write code that passes the test, then refactor the code to make it more efficient and concise and the loop occurs all over again.

Using this concept, I wrote tests that outlined my desired outcomes and wrote code to satisfy those tests. An Example test can be seen below:

```JavaScript
    describe('Circle Text Test',()=>{
        it('The circle text should equal dae', ()=>{ //tests if the circle's text is accurate
            const text = 'dae';
            const testCircle = new Circle(text);
            expect(testCircle.text).toEqual('dae');
        });
    });
```
